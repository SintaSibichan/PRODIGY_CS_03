A password strength checker is a tool designed to evaluate the security of a password by assessing various factors that contribute to its strength. It typically checks:

1. Length: Longer passwords are generally more secure.
2. Complexity*: Use of a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
3. Common Patterns*: Avoiding easily guessable patterns, such as "123456" or "password".
4. Personal Information*: Ensuring the password doesnâ€™t contain easily accessible personal information like names or birthdays.
